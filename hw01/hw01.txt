1a. I used the openvim tutorial.

1b. I completed all 20 stages of the tutorial.

2.  vi was used to write the entire homework

3.  :r log.c 

4a. 
#include <stdio.h>

// Main function prints all passed command line arguements.
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	if (argc == 0) {
		printf("Program name unavailable.\n");
		return -1;
	}
	for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) { 
		printf("Arguement %d:\t%s\n", i + 1, *(argv + i));
	}
	return 0;
}

4b. gcc -o args -Wall -g args.c

4c. ./args "The Maze Runner.mp4" 

5a. alias grep='grep -E'

5b. vi ~/.bashrc (modify personal initialization file in vim editor)
    /alias       (in command mode to find where other alias's are defined)
    i            (go to insert mode to add  alias's at desired location)
    alias grep='grep -E'	(add grep alias)
    esc          (go back to command mode)
    :wq          (save and quit)
    ctrl+alt+t   (need to open new terminal to observe applied changes)

6. argv[0] represents the name of the program.

7. Section 1: Contains user commands and tools. Typically these are modifiers
   to shell commands such as -a for the command ls which modifies ls
   to not ignore files beginning with a '.'.

   Section 2: Contains Linux system calls. These are not typically invoked
   directly, instead a correspondin C library wrapper function is
   used which perform the necessary steps to invoke the system call. 

   Section 3: Contains descriptions of all library functions excluding system
   call wrappers, which implement system calls described in Section 2.

   Section 4: Contains descriptions of special files typically found in the
   /dev directory (device files).

   Section 5: Contains various file formats and conventions.

   Section 6: Contains games.

   Section 7: Contains conventions and miscellaneous content. Many functions
   to create, modify and remove macros.

   Section 8: Contains administrative commands (commands only for the root
   user).

   Section 9: Contains routines usable only in kernel space.

8. enscript --header='$n %D $C|$%|Tyler Punch' hw01 -o Punch-Tyler-ECE331-HW01
