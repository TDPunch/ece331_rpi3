Assumptions: I am assuming that an 'english sentence' begins with a capital
character. I am also assuming since each sentence is on a single line that
each sentence has no preceeding spaces. All sentences will also end with one
punctuation mark. One word sentences are accepted. All words are seperated 
by a single space. Proper english convention is used (i.e. numbers greater 
than 9 shall be written out, only one digit numbers). I'm also allowing 
certain metcharacters you may see in an english sentence.

Unintended Matches: 'A.' will match but it's not really a sentence. 
It will also match '@@@@@' since I am accepting metacharacters (or really
any random combo of metachars). Can't really do this any better because you
can't know how they may be used.

6. I would attempt to meet with the highest ranking person(s) in the company as soon as I can. A physical meeting would be preferrable becuase I am completely 
unaware of the true contents of these 'trade secret' files and "Trinity's" 
intentions. And since she has a higher security clearence than myself I 
wouldn't want her to know about what I've seen which she could find out if she 
has administrative email access. I also need to explain myself to a higher-up 
ASAP becuase I performed an unethical action by impersonating root on the 
supercomputer and hadn't told anyone that I knew the root password when I 
shouldn't. This could lead to a misunderstanding, with the company thinking I 
may have been trying to sabotage/steal trade secrets.

   I would explain that I was only trying to fix the high speed network 
due to the upcoming demonsration to the clients. I would say I made a
judgement call to fix the network due to the potential significant loss in 
funding for the company and this demonstration was my responsibility. When
I say how I obtained the root password, I would be sure to convey that 
"Trinity" did not give me the password knowingly (and that it should probably
be changed from "12345"). After attempting to justify that my actions were
done for the good of the company, I would then bring up the files I found.

   Since I don't know what the files actually contain nor do I know "Trinity's" intentions there's not much more I can do about this. It's possible she's
meant to have that access to our companys trade secrets. And as for the other
companies files, I have no way of knowing how that information was obtained
so I don't know if any "theft" has taken place. And again thats assuming
it is what I think it is.
