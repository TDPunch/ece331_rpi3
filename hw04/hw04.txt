1. vi was used to write the entire homework.

2. sudo touch /usr/arm/opt/bin/foobar
   sudo ln -s /var/lib/systimer/logs /usr/arm/opt/bin/foobar

3. find * -regextype posix-egrep -regex -regex "^[0-9]{2}$" 
	-exec grep "^[0-9]+$" {}+ \;
NOTE: This command doesn't work but it was the closest I was able to get
I was working on for a while and needed to move on. It seems like
it should work but it appends the '+' character to the end of the file
names. Other than that it identifies the correct filenames and tries
to grep them.

4a. a#0

4b. a

4c. 6

4d. 6

5a. \b(0b)?[01]+\b

5b. 0

5. An unintended match to this RE is a floating point number where the 
floating point part contains only 1's and 0's.

6a. \-?\b[0-9]*[02468]\b

6b. 2

6. An unintended match to this RE is a floating point number where the 
floating point part contains ends in an even number.
 
7a. \-?[0-9]{,38}\.[0-9]{1,16}\b

7b. .1

7. For this one, because we can't put a word boundary at the beginning of the
RE it will match numbers where the int part exceeds the maximum integer
that can be represented in floating point, such as a 40 digit integer
with a decimal.
